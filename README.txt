# COVID19 Global project 

Made by Rahul Sharma 820943039 & Anmol Deep Gupta 823381384

What are the goals of your assignment?
We analysed the COVID-19 cases worldwide from Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
- We calculated total global cases, death rates, and deaths per day and did the same for US.
- Plotted interactive graphs and spatial bubble charts.


Did you succeed? 

Yes, based on the dataset we could convert it into easily readable formats that would encourage us to ask relevant questions. The goal of this project is 
to do data analysis, which although could mean different things to different people, but for us its to ask relevant questions and to answer those questions
based on data. One of the major goal was to learn to tell a story based on data and to encourage future decisions based on facts. 
PS: If the story has interactive images, that's just a bonus :)


What did you learn?
- How to set up the notebook such that each time the notebook is run, it uses the latest dataset from the source.
- How to plot interactive graphs and bubble charts. 
- How to do exploratory data analysis and ask relevant questions. 
- Learn fundamentals of data analysis.


Future scope:

In different hands, this project could amount to different things. But for us, we wanted to analyze air traffic data (World - 2020) and ratio of senior citizens per 100K population. These two analysis would have helped us find correlation betweem them and the spread of outbreak in different parts of the world. 

## To run:
Our notebook uses numpy, pandas and plotly.

To install plotly for this project. Which helps plot interactive graphs. Use 

pip install plotly==4.7.1 

or 

conda install -c plotly plotly=4.7.1
